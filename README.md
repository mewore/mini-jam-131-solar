# Like Moths to a Star

## TODO

- [x] ğŸ’š MVP idea - a side-scrolling 2d pixel art game, mostly focused on story
    - There's a bit of strategy involved - the player chooses which route to take; they're free to take the path to the
      sun immediately, but it will be very difficult or maybe impossible. Instead, they have to take paths to nearby
      celestial bodies (asteroids, moons, planets) to collect resources for upgrades first.
        - After a trip to a celestial body is over, the moth turns into a cocoon and the player can choose upgrades
          based on the collected resources.
        - (Just cosmetic, not a part of the MVP) At each celestial body, the player is shown what it looks like,
          with [lunar creatures](https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2008/11/20/elebits-the-adventures-of-kai-and-zero-20081120034550582-2655629.jpg)
          and [solar creatures](https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2006/05/10/elebits-20060509074340714-1497107.jpg) inhabiting
          it, perhaps.
    - While travelling, the player has to dodge debris and enemy projectiles, but since the focus is on the story, it
      won't be too challenging.
    - Boss fights when a certain difficulty is reached. The player starts at the bottom-left and has to reach the top-left (where the Sun is) and the difficulty increases diagonally in that direction... like this:
